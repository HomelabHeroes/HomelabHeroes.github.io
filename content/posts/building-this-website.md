This is my first *real* attempt at building and hosting a website, so I am going to do my best to document this as I go. 
___
First, I'm going to give a bit of an oversimplified explanation of the technical stack that will be (or by the time this is posted, *is being*) used:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - This is the framework we will use for generating our static site.
- git / GitHub - Version control system/repository for the codebase as we develop.
- GitHub Pages - this is how we will host our new website. 
- CloudFlare - this is my domain registrar / DNS provider of choice. 
- GitHub Actions - this will help us automate a deployment cycle (I believe all the cool kids these days refer to this as a "CI/CD Pipeline") between our local development environment and our published production website.
